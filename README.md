## Snake in Vanills JS

### Description
This page uses vanilla JavaScript to mimic the classic game Snake.
A player can use the arrow keys to move the snake about the board, without running the snake into itself.

The board lives in the DOM as a canvas element. An event listener exists to listen to arrow key events, which call moveSnake and recalculate the snake's state based on X and Y coordinates.

To play the game, open index.html in your favorite browser.
